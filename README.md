### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
  <div class="landing">
            <div class="landing-top">
                <div class="landing-top-img">
                    <!--backgorund image on css always-->
                    <div class="landing-top-logo">
                        <img src="images\logo.svg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div class="landing-top-text">
                        <h1>A history of everything you copy</h1>
                        <p>Clipboard allows you to track and organize everything you copy. Instantly access your
                            clipboard
                            in all your
                            devices.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="landing-top-btn">
                    <button class="btn-1">Download for iOS</button>
                    <button class="btn-2">Download for Mac</button>
                </div>
            </div>

        </div>
```
```css
.facebook :hover {
    filter: invert(61%) sepia(7%) saturate(3368%) hue-rotate(121deg) brightness(92%) contrast(84%);
}

.twitter :hover {
    filter: invert(61%) sepia(7%) saturate(3368%) hue-rotate(121deg) brightness(92%) contrast(84%);
}

.instagram :hover {
    filter: invert(61%) sepia(7%) saturate(3368%) hue-rotate(121deg) brightness(92%) contrast(84%);
}

```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on React in my future projects. These are some of the concepts I am still not completely comfortable with, I really want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/R7gqJkdc5dM) - This helped me decide when to use Flexbox or Grid.
- [Web Dev Simplified ](https://youtu.be/1PnVor36_40) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

I did get inspiration from Kevin Powell, he is a coding instructor in Youtube. I'd recommend it to anyone that is learning programing to check some of his videos.
