## Overview

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Github Pages](https://styled-components.com/) - Hosting

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on React in my future projects. These are some of the concepts I am still not completely comfortable with, I really want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/R7gqJkdc5dM) - This helped me decide when to use Flexbox or Grid.
- [Web Dev Simplified ](https://youtu.be/1PnVor36_40) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

I did get inspiration from Kevin Powell, he is a coding instructor in Youtube. I'd recommend it to anyone that is learning programing to check some of his videos.
